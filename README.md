# PIC-10C-Final-Project

The Idea:
While cramming during 10th week for my 4 finals and trying to simultaneously create my final project, I came up with an idea
on how I could accomplish two of those tasks in one.  Why not create my own version of quizlet with material corresponding to my GE, 
Anthro 2.  Using the study guide my professor provided for us, I created a study program that allows me to learn the material and be
tested on it as well using QT Designer.

The Project:
The GUI is laid out with a flashcarad in the center of the screen and two options to choose from on the top left.  All QWidgets are
locked until an option is selected.  If study is selected, the flashcard is set up to have a question on one side and the answer
on the other, with a click flipping the card.  You are able to scroll through all 91 terms continuously with the prev/next card button.
If test is selected, a question appears with the other side giving a choice of answers.  Next card is locked until the correct answer is
selected and your score is displayed at the top (calculated based on your first guess on every question).
